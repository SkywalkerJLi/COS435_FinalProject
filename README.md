# COS435 Final Project
Skywalker Li, Jack O'Donnell, Jack Deschenes

We forked the Stable Contrastive RL repo from here: https://github.com/chongyi-zheng/stable_contrastive_rl

Our Contribution:
- Reimplemented core contrastive RL algorithm in stable_contrastive_rl/rlkit/torch/sac/stable_contrastive_rl_trainer.py
- Reimplemented critic networks in stable_contrastive_rl/rlkit/networks/contrastive_networks.py
All files in the data, figures, video folders are ours
All other files besides the ones listed above are from the original paper.
